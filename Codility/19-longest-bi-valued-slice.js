/*
Write a function:

    def solution(A)

that, given an array A of N integers, returns the length of the longest
bi-valued slice in A

For example, given A = [4, 2, 2, 4, 2], the function should return 5.

Given A = [1, 2, 3, 2], the function should return 3.

Given A = [−1, −3, 0, 5, 4, 4, 5, 12 ], the function should return 4.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

-N is an integer within the range [1..100];
-each element of array A is an integer within the range |1,000,000,000|
*/

function solution(A) {
