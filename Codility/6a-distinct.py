'''DISTINCT
https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/6-sorting/distinct/

Write a function

    def solution(A)

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct
values in array A.

For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:
 A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
 A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1

the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in
array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

-N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
-each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000]

def solution(A):
    # return len(set(A)) #shortcut
    my_dictionary = {}
    for item in A:
        if item not in my_dictionary:
            my_dictionary[item] = True

    num_distinct = len(my_dictionary)
    return num_distinct

solution([2,1,1,2,3,1])
