''' FROG JUMP
https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/frog_jmp/

A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently
located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y
The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.

Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its
target.

Write a function:

    def solution(X, Y, D)

that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from
position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.

For example, given:
  X = 10
  Y = 85
  D = 30

the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

    after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
    after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
    after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
        X â‰¤ Y.

def solution(X, Y, D):
    distance = Y - X

    num_jump_float = float(distance / D)
    num_jump_int = int(distance / D)

    num_jump_need = num_jump_int
    if num_jump_float > num_jump_int:
        num_jump_need += 1

    return num_jump_need

def solution2(X, Y, D):
    distance = Y - X
    num_jump = distance / D
    whole_num_jump = distance // D
    return whole_num_jump + 1 if num_jump > whole_num_jump else whole_num_jump
