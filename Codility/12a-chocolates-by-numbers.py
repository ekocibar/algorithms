'''CHOCOLATES BY NUMBERS
https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/12-euclidean_algorithm/chocolates_by_numbers/

Two positive integers N and M are given. Integer N represents the number of
chocolates arranged in a circle, numbered from 0 to N − 1.

You start to eat the chocolates. After eating a chocolate you leave only a
wrapper.

You begin with eating chocolate number 0. Then you omit the next M − 1
chocolates or wrappers on the circle, and eat the following one.

More precisely, if you ate chocolate number X, then you will next eat the
chocolate with number (X + M) modulo N (remainder of division).

You stop eating when you encounter an empty wrapper.

For example, given integers N = 10 and M = 4. You will eat the following
chocolates: 0, 4, 8, 2, 6.

The goal is to count the number of chocolates that you will eat, following the
above rules.

Write a function:

    def solution(N, M)

that, given two positive integers N and M, returns the number of chocolates
that you will eat.

For example, given integers N = 10 and M = 4. the function should return 5, as
explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

    N and M are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
'''
def solution(N, M):
    # meet in the circle = number of chocolates that you will eat
    # number of chocolates = N / gcd(N, M)
    num_chocolates = N // gcd(N,M)
    return num_chocolates

# find gcd (greatest common divisor)
def gcd(a, b):
    if a % b == 0:
        return b
    else:
        return gcd(b, a%b)
