'''STONE WALL
https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/7-stacks_and_queues/stone_wall/

You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and N meters
long, and its thickness should be constant; however, it should have different
heights in different places. The height of the wall is specified by an array
H of N positive integers. H[I] is the height of the wall from I to I+1 meters
to the right of its left end. In particular, H[0] is the height of the wall's
left end and H[Nâˆ’1] is the height of the wall's right end.

The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of such
blocks are rectangular). Your task is to compute the minimum number of blocks
needed to build the wall.

Write a function:

    def solution(H)

that, given an array H of N positive integers specifying the height of the
wall, returns the minimum number of blocks needed to build it.

For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers:
  H[0] = 8    H[1] = 8    H[2] = 5
  H[3] = 7    H[4] = 9    H[5] = 8
  H[6] = 7    H[7] = 4    H[8] = 8

the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible arrangement of
seven blocks.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

    N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
    each element of array H is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

def solution(H):
    # key point: two different cases
    # case 1: from high to low
    # case 2: from low to high

    # use stack
    my_stack = []

    num_block = 0

    for i in range( len(H) ):

		# "stack is not empty" and "from high to low";
		# then, "pop" (it is the key point)
        while ( len(my_stack) !=0 ) and ( H[i] < my_stack[len(my_stack)-1] ):
            my_stack.pop( len(my_stack)-1 )

		# empty (stack)
        if len(my_stack) == 0:
            num_block += 1
            my_stack.append(H[i])

		# the height is the same
        elif H[i] == my_stack[ len(my_stack)-1 ] :
            # do nothing (no need to add any block)
            pass

		# from low to high
        elif H[i] >= my_stack[ len(my_stack)-1 ] :
            num_block += 1
            my_stack.append(H[i])

    return num_block
